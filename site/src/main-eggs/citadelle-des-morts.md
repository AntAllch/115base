<h3 id='egg-steps'>Pre-Steps - Get the Basic Swords</h3>

- The easter egg cannot be done without the upgraded swords, so the first step is to get the Basic Swords

- To get the swords, you must wait until atleast round 10 and kill a zombie wearing a knights helmet, it will drop a stamp

- You then interact with any of the 4 Knights statues holding a sword and you will then be given a sword to pick up

- Each Knight corresponds to a different sword, either Lightning (Stag), Fire (Dragon), Dark (Raven), or Light (Lion). The Animal associated with each Sword is on the Knights armour. The Stag, Dragon and Lion are on the Chest of the armour, the Raven is sat on the Knights Left Shoulder

<h3 id='lightning-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Lightning Sword (Stag)</h3> <br>

- Pick up 3 Lightning Rods: One is next to Deadshot, one you obtain by shooting the electrical box near Speed Cola using a weapon with Dead Wire attached, and the last one drops from a Zombie.

- Once you have obtained all 3, go to a Vase at Hillside Ramparts and interact with it to place all 3 lightning rods inside it

- A storm will appear and you have to get kills with the Stag sword until it has electricity around the blade, you then hit the Vase to transfer the electricity into it

- Once you have done all 3, interact with the Vase and it will place the sword inside, you have to wait a minute and it will return the upgraded Lightning Sword

---

<h3 id='fire-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Fire Sword (Dragon)</h3> <br>

- Take the Basic sword and interact with the dragon head at the top of the stairs in Entrance Hall, your Sword will then be placed inside and the dragon will activate

- There will be 3 Braziers that are now filled with fire, you must go to each one and interact with it, you will then be covered with fire and you must run back to the Dragon where you placed your sword

- The 3 locations are Village Ramparts (near the Lion Cannon), Town Square and (3rd location)

- To make sure you don't die, you can one hit kill Zombies on the way to the dragon and it will fully restore your health

- MAKE SURE YOU DONT RUN OUT OF HEALTH BECAUSE IT WILL END YOUR GAME

- Once you have done all 3, the Dragon will breath fire on your sword and you can pick up your Upgraded sword

<h3 id='dark-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Dark Sword (Raven)</h3> <br>

- In the Alchemical Room, you need to find 1 of 5 items, the item you need to pick up may change each time you start a new game

- The item you are looking for is either: Ram horn, Scorpion, Fish Rock, Raven Skulls or Jaw Bone

- Once you have the correct item, head down to the Tavern Cellar and interact with the puzzle on the wall (opposite the red portal) to put the item into the puzzle, interact with it again to place the sword inside and then interact with it for a 3rd time to begin the puzzle

- You now need to turn the 2 dials to line up the right symbols with the green symbol at the bottom (in the 6 oclock position)

- Once you have entered the correct symbol pair, a portal will open up on the floor in the Tavern Cellar, little purple orbs will start to come out of the puzzle on the wall and move towards you, you need to lead them into the portal by standing the opposite side of the portal so the orbs are sucked into it

- BE AWARE THAT THESE ORBS CAN DAMAGE YOU IF THEY TOUCH YOU

- Once you have lead 3 orbs into the portal, the portal will move to a second location, the floor above, in the Tavern

- Once you have completed the 2nd portal, it will move to a third location, in the Tavern again, next to the pool table

- When you have compeleted all 3 portals, an orb will make its way back down to the puzzle on the wall, once it reaches it, you must interact with the puzzle

- A void will open up in the floor and your sword will go into the void and return your Upgraded Dark Sword

<h3 id='light-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Light Sword (Lion)</h3> <br>


- Once you pick up the Basic Sword from the Knight with the Lion armour, 4 glowing Parasites will appear, take them to the door with the Lion head knocker at (location)

- Now you must kill the parasites with the Lion Sword, 1 at a time, once you have killed 1, your sword will glow, hit the door with the Lion head knocker on it using the glowing Lion sword, a symbol will appear on the door, repeat this until you have all 4 glowing symbols on the door

- Once all 4 symbols are on the door, interact with it to go into the room behind the door

- You will come up to a pedestal at the back of the room, interact with it to place your sword into it

- You'll see 4 symbols floating in the air and a symbol glowing on the pedestal, you must shoot the same symbol floating in the air as the one on the pedestal, do this for all 4 symbols and your sword will start glowing

- You can now pick up your upgraded Light Sword
