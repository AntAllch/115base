<h3 id='egg-steps'>Easter Egg Pre-Steps</h3>

- In order to progress this egg, you must get the Basic Swords and upgrade to all 4 Elemental Swords, get all 4 incantations and complete all 4 Point of Power Traps

- You can either complete all 4 Point of Power Traps OR Sword upgrades first, but the incantations can only be collected once you have completed the corresponding Sword element

- Once you have completed the Swords, incantations and Power Traps, you can move onto the next stage

---

### Step 1 - Knights Salute <br>

- After the first set of stairs leading down from the Sitting Room into the Undercroft, you will see a wall with an Orb holder and 4 symbols on it, these symbols correspond to the Elemental Swords (Lightning, Fire, Light, Dark)

- Pay attention to the order of the symbols because the next stage must be done in the correct order. The correct order is a clockwise direction from the top (so the 12, 3, 6 and 9 oclock positions)

- You must use the incantation on the Knight so he glows and then weapon inspect infront of that same Knight, he will then salute and a yellow glow will appear on the Knight (Example: Use the Fire incantation on the Dragon Knight, the Lightning incantation on the Stag Knight, etc)

- You do this infront of all 4 Knights and they MUST be done in the correct order

---

<h3 class='space'>Step 2 - Orb Trials</h3>

Once they all have a yellow glow on them, you will see 4 white beams fire up into the centre of the knights area and they will bring down a white orb, collect the orb and you are ready for the trials stage. You must complete 4 different trials ([Light](#lightning-sword), [Dark](#dark-sword), [Fire](#fire-sword), [Lightning](#lightning-sword))

---

### Step 3 - Guardian Key <br>

- When you have finished all 4 trials, head back to the wall with the 4 symbols on it and place the orb onto the holder on the wall, the wall will then open up and you can go inside the room behind it

- A Ghost of the Owl will appear above the table in the room and talk, while he is talking you can pick up the guardian key (you do not have to listen to what he says, you can just grab the key and run back to Spawn)

- Once you have the key, go back to the Town Square and interact with the front of the Titan statue to place the key into it, the statue will then come to life and you will be teleported into the Boss arena

---

<h3 id='egg-steps'>Get the Basic Swords</h3>

- The easter egg cannot be done without the upgraded swords, so the first step is to get the Basic Swords

- To get the swords, you must wait until atleast round 10 and kill a zombie wearing a knights helmet, it will drop a stamp

- You then interact with any of the 4 Knights statues holding a sword and you will then be given a sword to pick up

- Each Knight corresponds to a different sword, either Lightning (Stag), Fire (Dragon), Dark (Raven), or Light (Lion). The Animal associated with each Sword is on the Knights armour. The Stag, Dragon and Lion are on the Chest of the armour, the Raven is sat on the Knights Left Shoulder

---

<h3 id='lightning-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Lightning Sword (Stag)</h3> <br>

- Pick up 3 Lightning Rods: One is next to Deadshot, the next one you obtain by using a Shock Charge on the electrical box near Speed Cola OR shooting it using a weapon with Dead Wire attached, and the last one drops from a Zombie (to get this one, you must have the Basic Stag Sword and the zombie will spawn in when you are in the Dungeon).

- Once you have obtained all 3, go to a Vase at Hillside Ramparts and interact with it to place all 3 lightning rods inside it

- A storm will appear and you have to survive with the Stag sword equipped until it has electricity around the blade, you then hit the Vase to transfer the electricity into it

- Once you have done all 3, interact with the Vase and it will place the sword inside, you have to wait a few seconds and it will return the upgraded Lightning Sword

---

<h3 id='fire-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Fire Sword (Dragon)</h3> <br>

- Take the Basic Dragon Sword and interact with the dragon head at the top of the stairs in Entrance Hall, your Sword will then be placed inside and the dragon will activate

- There will be 3 Braziers that are now filled with fire, you must go to each one and interact with it, you will then be covered with fire and you must run back to the Dragon where you placed your sword and interact with it to transfer the fire into the Dragon

- The 3 locations are Village Ramparts (near the Lion Cannon), Town Square and Nature Path (near the gate to Town Square)

- To make sure you don't die, you can one hit kill Zombies on the way to the dragon and it will fully restore your health

- <span class='note-text'>MAKE SURE YOU DONT RUN OUT OF HEALTH OTHERWISE IT WILL END YOUR GAME</span>

- Once you have done all 3, the Dragon will breath fire on your sword and you can pick up your Upgraded sword

---

<h3 id='dark-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Dark Sword (Raven)</h3> <br>

- Pick up the Basic Raven Sword and go to the Alchemical Room, you need to find 1 of 5 items, the item you need to pick up may change each time you start a new game

- The item you are looking for is either: Ram horn, Scorpion, Fish Rock, Raven Skulls or Jaw Bone

- Once you have the correct item, head down to the Tavern Cellar and interact with the puzzle on the wall (opposite the red portal) to put the item into the puzzle, interact with it again to place the sword inside and then interact with it for a 3rd time to begin the puzzle

- You now need to turn the 2 dials to line up the right symbols with the green symbol at the bottom (in the 6 oclock position)

<div class='dark-puzzle-groups'>

- Once you have entered the correct symbol pair, a portal will open up on the floor in the Tavern Cellar, little purple orbs will start to come out of the puzzle on the wall and move towards you, you need to lead them into the portal by standing the opposite side of the portal so the orbs are sucked into it

- <span class='note-text'>BE AWARE THAT THESE ORBS CAN DAMAGE YOU IF THEY TOUCH YOU</span>

- Once you have lead 3 orbs into the portal, the portal will move to a second location, the floor above, in the Tavern

- Once you have completed the 2nd portal, it will move to a third location, in the Tavern again, next to the pool table

- When you have compeleted all 3 portals, an orb will make its way back down to the puzzle on the wall, once it reaches it, you must interact with the puzzle

- A void will open up in the floor and your sword will go into the void and return your Upgraded Dark Sword

---

<h3 id='light-sword'>Upgrade Swords - Light Sword (Lion)</h3> <br>


- Once you pick up the Basic Sword from the Knight with the Lion armour, 4 glowing Parasites will appear, take them to the door with the Lion head knocker at Upper Village (in the covered section, on the right side of the Ammo Cache)

- Now you must kill the parasites with the Lion Sword, 1 at a time, once you have killed 1, your sword will glow, hit the door with the Lion head knocker on it using the Sword, a symbol will appear on the door, repeat this until you have all 4 glowing symbols on the door

- Once all 4 symbols are on the door, interact with it

- You will then be placed inside a room, you'll come up to a pedestal at the back of the room, interact with it to place your Sword into it

- You'll see 4 symbols floating in the air and a symbol glowing on the pedestal, you must shoot the same symbol floating in the air that appears on the pedestal, do this for all 4 symbols and your Sword will start glowing

- You can now pick up your upgraded Light Sword

---

<h3 id='lightning-incantation'>Incantation - Lightning (Stag)</h3> <br>

- To start this incantation step, you need to collect <span class='note-incantation'>Otto's Horseshoe</span>

- Head to the Barn on Hilltop, and go through the doorway to the right of Deadshot, turn left and you will see another doorway, above that you will see a horseshoe, just shoot it and it will drop onto the floor, you can now interact with it to pick it up

- <span class='note-text'>BE AWARE FOR THIS NEXT STEP, YOU MUST HAVE SPOKEN TO KRAFFT FOR THE LIGHTING STRIKE TO APPEAR</span>

- Head to the Lion Cannon at the Castle and interact with it to go inside it (this cost 500 points), it will now shoot you back over to Town Square, as you are being shot through the air, a bolt of lightning will appear and you will lose the horseshoe from your inventory

- Once you have landed, look up in the sky for a dark grey cloud with lightning appearing from it (it will take a couple of seconds to appear), go to the cloud and on the floor you will see the horseshoe, interact with it to pick it up (be careful when you approach it because the storm spawns in Zombies)

- Go back into Town Square and go towards the gate that leads to Nature Path, move towards the left of the gate (while still in Town Square), and you will see a golden circular pattern appear on the floor, stand over it and hold your interact button and it will place the horseshoe down

- This will start spawning in Zombies, you must kill them in order for the Zombie souls to go into the horseshoe (basically a soul box)

- Once you have enough souls, a shockwave will appear and kill the rest of the Zombies, a gold glowing chest will then appear out of the floor, to open it, you have to hit it with the corresponding Upgraded Sword, so in this case, the Lightning Sword

---

<h3 id='fire-incantation'>Incantation - Fire (Dragon)</h3> <br>

- To start this incantation step, you need to collect <span class='note-incantation'>Ra's Ankh</span>

- <span class='note-text'>BE AWARE FOR THIS NEXT STEP, YOU MUST HAVE SPOKEN TO KRAFFT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SET THE PYRES ON FIRE</span>

- The first step is to set 3 pyres on fire, you can do this by either throwing a Molotov, using the Fire Sword ability, Thermogrenades or Hellstorm Scorestreak (although the last 2 are difficult, so I would avoid these options)

- One pyre can be seen from Hillside Rampart above the entrance to the room with Elemental Pop, the second pyre is on the cliff above Speed Cola (this can be accessed easier by standing infront of the buyable wall, to the left of the unlit Brazier), and the 3rd pyre is above the door that leads into the castle (you can see this by standing infront of the Lion Cannon, facing the castle)

- Each time you set a pyre on fire, it will spawn in a few zombies. Once all 3 are lit, it will spawn in a Doppelghast

- <span class='note-text'>NOTE: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KILL ANY ZOMBIES THAT SPAWN IN, AS LONG AS ALL 3 PYRES ARE LIT, THE DOPPELGHAST WILL SPAWN IN</span>

- Kill the Doppleghast and it will drop Ra's Ankh, interact with it to pick it up

- Now head to the wall opposite the gate that leads to Upper Village and a golden circular pattern will appears on the floor, stand over it and hold your interact button and it will place down Ra's Ankh

- This will start spawning in Zombies, you must kill them in order for the Zombie souls to go into the Ankh (basically a soul box)

- Once you have enough souls, a shockwave will appear and kill the rest of the Zombies, a gold glowing chest will then appear out of the floor, to open it, you have to hit it with the corresponding Upgraded Sword, so in this case, the Fire Sword

---

<h3 id='dark-incantation'>Incantation - Dark (Raven)</h3> <br>

- To start this incantation step, you need to collect the <span class='note-incantation'>Raven's Foot</span>

- Head to the Oubliette Room and at the far end, near the Pack-a-Punch machine, you will see a circular grate on the floor, interact with it and you will be taken through a shortcut in the sewers

- <span class='note-text'>BE AWARE FOR THIS NEXT STEP, YOU MUST HAVE SPOKEN TO KRAFFT IN ORDER FOR THE RAVEN TO APPEAR</span>

- When you are near the end of the sewer, on the right hand side you will see a Black Raven, you must shoot it with a bullet weapon (be careful, because you come down quite fast, so you might miss the Raven)

- When you have successfully shot it, it will fly off. When you have landed back on the floor, look up and you will see the Raven. Shoot it with any bullet weapon and it will drop the Raven's Foot. Once it has landed, interact with it to pick it up

- Now head down to the undercroft and walk towards the wall opposite the doorway to the Oubliette Room (inbetween the mystery box location and the doorway to Sitting Room), a golden circular pattern will appear on the floor, stand over it and hold your interact button and it will place down the Raven's Foot

- This will start spawning in Zombies, you must kill them in order for the Zombie souls to go into the Raven's Foot (basically a soul box)

- Once you have enough souls, a shockwave will appear and kill the rest of the Zombies, a gold glowing chest will then appear out of the floor, to open it, you have to hit it with the corresponding Upgraded Sword, so in this case, the Dark Sword

---

<h3 id='light-incantation'>Incantation - Light (Lion)</h3> <br>

- To start this incantation step, you need to collect <span class='note-incantation'>Paladin's Brooch</span>

- <span class='note-text'>BE AWARE FOR THIS NEXT STEP, YOU MUST HAVE SPOKEN TO KRAFFT IN ORDER FOR THE CRYSTALS TO SHINE</span>

- Head to the Dining Room (Knights Room) and look above at where the ceiling used to be, above and infront of the Vulture Aid machine, you will see a glowing red crystal

- Shoot that crystal and it will generate a beam, you have to shoot it until it aligns with the next crystal (the beam will go from  blurry to concentrated)

- Each time you shoot the crystal correctly, it will go to the next crystal, do this 4 seperate times and once it has reached the last one, it will send the beam to a half mannequiun figure on a desk in the Alchemical Lab

- Once it does this, Paladins Brooch will appear on the mannequin, after a few seconds, stand in front of the mannequin to break the beam, a couple of seconds later you will be able to interact with the Brooch and pick it up

- Head to the Lion artwork on the wall in the Dining Room, on the right side of the door leading to the Entrance Hall, and a golden circular pattern will appear on the floor, stand over it and hold your interact button and it will place down Paladin's Brooch

- This will start spawning in Zombies, you must kill them in order for the Zombie souls to go into the Brooch (basically a soul box)

- Once you have enough souls, a shockwave will appear and kill the rest of the Zombies, a gold glowing chest will then appear out of the floor, to open it, you have to hit it with the corresponding Upgraded Sword, so in this case, the Upgraded Lion Sword
