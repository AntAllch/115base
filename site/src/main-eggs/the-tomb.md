<h3 class='space' id="base-ice-staff">Step 1 - Build Ice Staff</h3>  

- Obtain the Monocle, by killing the Shock Mimic that spawns in on Round 8

- In The Tombs (where Death Perception is), shoot the Aetheric Lamp until it appears in the holder facing the left side of the entrance leading underground, once it's in the correct place, some symbols will appear on the wall, these are Roman numerals (1-8)

- Shoot them In the correct order, from 1 to 8, once you have shot all 8 of them, it will show a constellation on the wall, A purple light will then appear and your screen will turn white

- Complete all 6 waves of enemies. Once you have finished, the staff part will appear in front of the constellation, as well as a Max Ammo drop

- Head to *location* (Crafting Bench room, next to the room with Deadshot) and repeat the step with the Aetheric Lantern until the Roman Numeral symbols show up. Shoot all 10 symbols in order, complete all 6 waves of enemies and pick up 2nd Staff part along with the Max Ammo drop

- Go to the Dark Aether and near the Pack-a-Punch machine you will see a half circle wall with a hole in the middle, walk up to the hole and interact with it to place down the staff, your screen will flash white and start the protection step

- You must kill all the enemies with a purple glow before they can damage the Staff, be careful because you can fail this step quite quickly if you dont pay attention to the correct zombies <span class='green-text'>TIP: Place down 2 energy mines near the Staff and then kill enemies away from the staff, like near the red portal, and the turrets will take care of the purple glow zombies (make sure you have the extra charge and turret augments equipped)</span>

- Once this step has finished, the screen will flash white and you can then pick up the staff

- <span class='note-text'>NOTE: YOU CAN COLLECT THE STAFF PARTS IN ANY ORDER</span>

<h3 class='space' id='upgraded-ice-staff'>Step 2 - Upgrade Ice Staff</h3>

- Use the staff to shoot 3 Aetheric Lamps to freeze them within 10 seconds of each other, if you are successful, you will hear a quote from Archibold

- Go to the Dark Aether and head towards the middle of the map and look up towards the sky where all the floating rocks are, you need to look for rocks with glowing purple symbols on them, once you have found one, shoot the synbol with the Ice Staff and the rock will lower itself down so you can see the symbol easier, you have to do this on 3 different rocks

- <span class='note-text'>NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER THE SYMBOLS, YOU'LL NEED TO USE THEM IN THE NEXT STEP</span>

- Once you have all 3 symbols, you'll notice one of the portals will close, you need to make your way to the other side of that portal and you'll see the symbols, shoot them in any order using the Ice Staff and the portal will re-open <span class='green-text'>TIP: You'll know if you shot the correct symbols because they will appear on the bottom on the portal once it reopens</span>

- Go through the portal and you'll be teleported to a floating rock with a purple orb in front of you, interact with the orb and the screen will flash white.

- You now need to follow the orb and stay close to it. When the orb stops moving, you'll need to get some kills so it moves again. Repeat those steps and follow the orb all the way round the Dark Aether until it goes to the hole in the wall where you placed the Base Ice Staff. Once this is complete, the screen will flash white again

- Now you can interact with the wall and the Ice Staff will be upgraded

<h3 class='space'>Step 3 - Complete all 4 Trials</h3>

- For this next step you need to use the Green Gem on the other side of the Ice Staff and shoot the crystal located at the small enemy statue infront of one of the big spikes in the Dark Aether, once you have done this, you interact with the glowing crystal to pick it up, now head to the where the other small enemy statue is and interact with it to start the trial. 

- Once you have completed it, interact with the small statue and you'll see a purple glow appear around the edge of the screen, you need to run back to the statue in the Dark Aether and interact with it to transfer the energy to it. You need to do this 4 times, once for each enemy statue and they can only be done in a set order. Below is the order you need to do them in and how you complete each trial

- When you have completed all 4, you can interact with the pedestal where the broken floating bridge sections are (on the left of the Yellow portal) and now you are ready to go to the Boss fight

- <span class='green-text' id='vermin-trial'>Vermin Trial - Dig Site -</span> For this trial, you just need to kill a certain amount of Vermin within the time limit (this time limit is not shown on screen)

- <span class='green-text' id='parasite-trial'>Parasite Trial - Shrine of the Hierophants -</span> For this trial, you need to kill Parasites with a purple glow, when you kill them, they will drop a purple orb, you need to run over to it and it will automatically pick it up, now take it to the glowing statue and it will transfer the energy. Just keep doing this until you transfer the correct amount (usually around 10 or so)

- <span class='green-text' id='doppelghast-trial'>Doppelghast Trial - Ossuary -</span> For this trial, similar to the Vermin trial, you just need to kill Doppelghasts within the time limit (this time limit is not shown on screen) <span class='green-text'>TIP: Use charged Ice Staff shots to kill them</span>

- <span class='green-text' id='amalgam-trial'>Amalgam Trial - Deep Excavation -</span> For this trial, you need to kill an Amalgam, once its health is down to a certain amount, it will generate a shield and tether to another Zombie, just kill that Zombie and the shield will disappear, and you can carry on damaging the Amalgam, repeat these steps until you have killed it
