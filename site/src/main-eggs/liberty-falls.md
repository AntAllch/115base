<h3 id='egg-steps'>Step 1: Build the jet gun</h3>


Build the Jet Gun

---

### Step 2: Collect the LTG parts

Collect the 3 parts for the LTG using the Jet Gun

---

### Step 3: Build the LTG

Build the LTG using the build table on the Bank roof (The Alomo, Where Wunderfizz is located)

---

### Step 4: Interact with Church machine

Head to the Church and interact with the machine (on the right hand side, as you go in through the main entrance)

---

### Step 5: Place cannister on trap

Once the dialog has ended, pick up the tube that is inside the machine and place it on the floor on top one of the traps near Speed Cola

---

### Step 6: Summon HVT #1

Go to the aether storm in the Graveyard and hold interact on the floor underneath the storm to place the LTG

---

### Step 7: Protect device

Protect the device for 1 minute and prevent it from being destroyed (only purple eyed zombies can damage the device)

---

### Step 8: Trap HVT #1

Once the 1 minute timer is up, a HVT wll spawn in (a Mangler or an Abomination), get its health extremely low but dont kill it, lead it to the tube you placed on the trap earlier and activate the trap. the HVT must now die inside the trap, so make sure to lead it directly inside the trap, (you can shoot the HVT while it is inside the trap to speed up killing it), once it has been killed, its soul will go into the tube

---

### Step 9: Take cannister back to Church

Pick up the tube, once you do this, you have 1m 29s to get back to the church (NOTE: you can't sprint while holding the tube), once you are there you must interact with the machine to place the tube back into it

---

### Step 10: Grab Strauss Counter

Interact with the computer on the left side of the machine and a draw will open, pickup the Strauss Counter that appears inside the draw and then pick up the LTG device from the Graveyard

---

### Step 11: Set laser colour

There are 3 lasers scattered around the map (one is located near the groundskeeper shed, one is on the grass bank opposide Liberty Lanes and the other one is located on top of Freedom Fried Chicken, this one is accessible from the Bank roof), you need to head to each one and pull out the Strauss Counter. Hold interact on the laser and make sure you set the light to the correct colour (Yellow Counter means yellow light. Green Counter means Red light. Red Counter means Green light)

---

### Step 12: Grab cannister from spawn and place on trap

Once this is done, 3 beams of energy will transfer to the device in spawn, when this has finished, an Aether Cannister will come out of the device, pick it up and place it on top of the trap in spawn

---

### Step 13: Summon HVT #2 and lead to trap

Go to the aether storm in Riverside and hold interact on the floor underneath the storm to place the LTG. Repeat the steps from earlier (protect the LTG for 1 minute, get the HVT health really low lead to the trap, activae the trap and make sure the HVT dies inside the trap)

---

### Step 14: Take cannister back to church

Once the HVT soul has gone into the Aether Cannister, pick it up and take it back to the church (again, you have 1m 29s to get back to the church and you can't sprint while holding the tube), interact with the machine to place the Aether Cannister inside

---
<p class="note"> <strong>The next step is the final step to get to the boss fight, make sure you are fully prepared with all the items, perks and weapon rarity you need. The boss fight is inside the Church, so you have access to the PAP machine and an Ammo Cache</strong> </p>

---

### Step 15: Boss fight

Interact with the computer on the left of machine and you will enter the boss fight. You will enter 3 waves of enemies, each with a HVT. The first 2 waves HVTs are Manglers and the final wave is an abomination. Once you finish the 3rd wave, the screen will go white and you will be downed (don't worry this is supposed to happen).
