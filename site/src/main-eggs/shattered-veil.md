<h3 class='space' id="base-ice-staff">EGG STEPS COMING SOON</h3>  

<!-- - <span class='note-text'>NOTE: YOU CAN COLLECT THE STAFF PARTS IN ANY ORDER</span> -->

---

<!-- <h3 class='space' id='upgraded-ice-staff'>Step 2 - Upgrade Ice Staff</h3>

- Use the staff to shoot 3 Aetheric Lamps to freeze them within 10 seconds of each other, if you are successful, you will hear a quote from Archibold

- Go to the Dark Aether and head towards the middle of the map and look up towards the sky where all the floating rocks are, you need to look for rocks with glowing purple symbols on them, once you have found one, shoot the synbol with the Ice Staff and the rock will lower itself down so you can see the symbol easier, you have to do this on 3 different rocks

- <span class='note-text'>NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER THE SYMBOLS, YOU'LL NEED TO USE THEM IN THE NEXT STEP</span>

- Once you have all 3 symbols, you'll notice one of the portals will close, you need to make your way to the other side of that portal and you'll see the symbols, shoot them in any order using the Ice Staff and the portal will re-open <span class='green-text'>TIP: You'll know if you shot the correct symbols because they will appear on the bottom on the portal once it reopens</span>

- Go through the portal and you'll be teleported to a floating rock with a purple orb in front of you, interact with the orb and the screen will flash white.

- You now need to follow the orb and stay close to it. When the orb stops moving, you'll need to get some kills so it moves again. Repeat those steps and follow the orb all the way round the Dark Aether until it goes to the hole in the wall where you placed the Base Ice Staff. Once this is complete, the screen will flash white again

- Now you can interact with the wall and the Ice Staff will be upgraded
