 name: Iradite
 description: These can be found in Plains of Eidilon, on Earth, mainly around Grineer bases (marked by a little mountain icon on the map), they appear as black rocks with little red glowing rocks on them
 tips: These can be found near cliffs, rocky areas and Grineer camps, look near Gara Toht Lake, Twin Horns, and Northwest of the Seethe for increased chances to find them. Use Mods such as Thief's Wit or Animal Instinct to highlight loot. Using Archwing will also help you find them easier, because you can search from above
