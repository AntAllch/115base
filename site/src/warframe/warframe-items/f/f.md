 name: Fish Oil 
 description: Catch some fish using your fishing rod and then take it to a fisher merchant to convert them to oil. (e.g. Catch fish in a lake in Plains of Eidilon on Earth, and take them to Fisher Hai-Luk in Cetus)
 tips: Best fish to catch are Twilight and Mortus Lung Fish (abundant during the day in Lakes), Norg (best caught at night in Ponds), Charc Eels (can be caught day or night in Rivers). For more visibility of the fish, use Luminious Dye (can be bought from Hai-Luk) and carry multiple Spears and bait types to handle different fish sizes and environments
