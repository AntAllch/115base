 name: Grokdrul
 description: These can be found in Plains of Eidilon, on Earth, as cannisters in Grineer camps (marked by a little mountain icon on the map)
 tips: Focus on breaking the glowing cannisters in Grineer camps, rather than relying on enemy drops. Nekros' warframe ability Desecrate can sometimes double drops from Grokdrul cannisters
